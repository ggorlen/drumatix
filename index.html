      Welcome to my Roland TR-606 page!
    </p>    
    <p>
      I first heard the 606 when my best friend in high school gave me
      recordings by his brother, <a href="https://www.discogs.com/release/13952695-Lou-Gigger-Music-for-People-Who-Hate-Vocalists-Noise-for-People-Who-Hate-Music">Lou Gigger</a>.
      The snappy, aggressive sound of the TR-606 and Lou's busy, skittering programming had me hooked.
      It's been my favorite drum machine since.
    </p>
    <p>
      Compared to other machines like the 808 and 909, the 606 has always had a tinnier, less thumpy sound.
      I tend to associate it more with underground music than the A-level productions the 808 and 909 are known for.
      A 606 sounds great with distortion and on tape.
    </p>
    <p>
      The 80s and 90s are probably the prime periods for 606 recordings. During the 80s, most of the 606 music
      I know of that use the 606 are industrial, minimal synth and cassette culture recordings. During the 90s,
      IDM seems to be the 
    </p>
    <p>
      Other drum machines I associate with underground 80s music are the TR-707, Korg KR-55, 
      Roland compurhythm CR-8000. There are many brilliant recordings featuring these machines and I'd like to list them here eventually.
    </p>
    <p>
      I used to own a 606 and made a couple tapes with it but eventually sold it along with most of my music gear.

           This is the "holy grail" of IDM TR-606 for me. A few tracks don't have the 606, but 80% of the album is pure Roland MC-202 and 606.
