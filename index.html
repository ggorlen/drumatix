        <h2>My 606 story</h2>
        <p>
          I first heard the 606 when my best friend in high school gave me
          recordings by his brother,
          <a
            href="https://www.discogs.com/release/13952695-Lou-Gigger-Music-for-People-Who-Hate-Vocalists-Noise-for-People-Who-Hate-Music"
            >Lou Gigger</a
          >. The snappy, aggressive sound of the TR-606 and Lou's busy,
          skittering programming had me hooked. It's been my favorite drum
          machine since.
        </p>
        <p>
          Compared to other machines like the 808 and 909, the 606 has a
          tinnier, crisper, less thumpy sound. I tend to associate it more with
          underground music than the A-level productions the 808 and 909 are
          known for. A 606 sounds great with distortion and on tape.
        </p>
        <p>
          The 80s and 90s are probably the prime periods for 606 recordings.
          During the 80s, most of the 606 music I know of that use the 606 are
          industrial, minimal synth and cassette culture recordings. During the
          90s, IDM seems to be the genre that most featured the 606.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other drum machines I associate with underground 80s music are the
          Korg KR-55, Boss DR-55, Roland TR-707 and Roland CR-8000. There are
          many brilliant recordings featuring these machines and I'd like to
          list them here eventually.
        </p>
        <p>
          I used to own a 606 and made a couple tapes with it but eventually
          sold it along with most of my music gear.

              This Autechre alias is the holy grail of IDM TR-606 for me. A few
              tracks don't have the 606, but 80% of the album is pure Roland
              MC-202 and 606. The programming pushes the 606 to the limits.

            <p>Fantastic, driving 606 IDM classic that kicks off Incunabula.</p>

            >
            <p>Basically a demo version of the beautiful "Eggshell" from Incunabula with a 606 and Gescom-style cut-up vocals.
              This track nicely illustrates how cool the 606 sounds with rolling accented snares. The 606 is augmented with percussion
              samples, so it's not the most distilled example of the machine.</p>

              One of my favorite 80s minimal synth tapes. A great example of
              saturated and disorted 606.
