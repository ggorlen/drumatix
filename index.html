        <h2>My 606 story</h2>
        <p>
          I first heard the 606 when my best friend in high school gave me
          recordings by his brother,
          <a
            href="https://www.discogs.com/release/13952695-Lou-Gigger-Music-for-People-Who-Hate-Vocalists-Noise-for-People-Who-Hate-Music"
            >Lou Gigger</a
          >. The snappy, aggressive sound of the TR-606 and Lou's busy,
          skittering programming had me hooked. It's been my favorite drum
          machine since.
        </p>
        <p>
          Compared to other machines like the 808 and 909, the 606 has a
          tinnier, crisper, less thumpy sound. I tend to associate it more with
          underground music than the A-level productions the 808 and 909 are
          known for. A 606 sounds great with distortion and on tape.
        </p>
        <p>
          The 80s and 90s are probably the prime periods for 606 recordings.
          During the 80s, most of the 606 music I know of that use the 606 are
          industrial, minimal synth and cassette culture recordings. During the
          90s, IDM seems to be the genre that most featured the 606.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other drum machines I associate with underground 80s music are the
          Korg KR-33, Korg KPR-77, Boss DR-55, Roland TR-707 and Roland CR-8000. There are
          many brilliant recordings featuring these machines and I'd like to
          list some highlights here eventually.
        </p>
        <p>
          I used to own a 606 and made a couple tapes with it but eventually
          sold it along with most of my music gear. I used the 606 trigger outs to
          step a Sequential Circuits Pro One and the din sync alongside
          a Roland MC-202 and a CR-8000.

              This Autechre alias is the holy grail of IDM TR-606 for me. A few
              tracks don't have the 606, but 80% of the album is pure Roland
              MC-202 and 606. The programming pushes the 606 to the limits.

              The release that kicked off my 606 interest.
              It's pure 606, guitar and bass, an experimental instrumental extravaganza.
              It's a hard release to describe because it doesn't sound like much else.

            <p>Fantastic, driving 606 IDM classic that kicks off Incunabula.</p>

            >
            <p>Basically a demo version of the beautiful "Eggshell" from Incunabula with a 606 and Gescom-style cut-up vocals.
              This track nicely illustrates how cool the 606 sounds with rolling accented snares. The 606 is augmented with percussion
              samples, so it's not the most distilled example of the machine.</p>

              One of my favorite 80s minimal synth tapes. A great example of
              saturated and disorted 606.

              Interesting instrumental darkwave album. All 606. The programming isn't technical,
              but it works perfectly on the album and sounds great with the electric bass.

              This recent discovery for me is a masterpiece of early 90's ambient techno.
              It has 808 and other machines on it, but the 606 hats, snare and toms do most of the heavy lifting.
