        <h2>My 606 story</h2>
        <p>
          I first heard the 606 when my best friend in high school gave me
          recordings by his brother,
          <a
            href="https://www.discogs.com/release/13952695-Lou-Gigger-Music-for-People-Who-Hate-Vocalists-Noise-for-People-Who-Hate-Music"
            >Lou Gigger</a
          >. The snappy, aggressive sound of the TR-606 and Lou's busy,
          skittering programming had me hooked. It's been my favorite drum
          machine since.
        </p>
        <p>
          Compared to other machines like the 808 and 909, the 606 has a
          tinnier, crisper, less thumpy sound. I tend to associate it more with
          underground music than the A-level productions the 808 and 909 are
          known for. A 606 sounds great with distortion and on tape.
        </p>
        <p>
          The 80s and 90s are probably the prime periods for 606 recordings.
          During the 80s, most of the 606 music I know of that use the 606 are
          industrial, minimal synth and cassette culture recordings. During the
          90s, IDM seems to be the genre that most featured the 606.
        </p>
          Roland has brought back the 606 in various forms, and its samples can
          be used digitally, but I'm mostly interested in recordings that use the
          original machine, or which are sonically in the spirit of it.
        <p>
          Other drum machines I associate with underground 80s music are the
          Korg KR-33, Korg KPR-77, Boss DR-55, Roland TR-707 and Roland CR-8000.
          There are many fantastic recordings featuring these machines and I'd
          like to list some highlights here eventually.
        </p>
        <p>
          I used to own a 606 and made a few tapes with it but eventually sold
          it along with most of my music gear. I used the 606 trigger outs to
          step a Sequential Circuits Pro One and the din sync alongside
          a Roland MC-202 and a CR-8000.

              This Autechre alias is the holy grail of IDM TR-606 for me. A few
              tracks don't have the 606, but 80% of the album is pure Roland
              MC-202 and 606. The programming pushes the 606 to the limits.

              The release that kicked off my 606 interest.
              It's pure 606, guitar and bass, an experimental instrumental extravaganza.
              It's a hard release to describe because it doesn't sound like much else.

              Basically a demo version of the beautiful "Eggshell" from Incunabula with a 606 and Gescom-style cut-up vocals.
              This track nicely illustrates how cool the 606 sounds with rolling accented snares. The 606 is augmented with percussion
              samples, so it's not the most distilled example of the machine.

              One of my favorite 80s minimal synth tapes. A great example of
              saturated and disorted 606.

              An early power electronics/rhythmic noise tape almost entirely
              comprised of distorted 606 running at extreme speeds.

              Interesting instrumental darkwave album. All percussion used the 606.
              The drum patterns are simple, but it works perfectly on the album
              and sounds great with the electric bass guitar.

              This recent discovery for me is a masterpiece of early 90's ambient techno.
              It has 808 and other machines on it, but the 606 hats, snare and toms do most of the heavy lifting.

            >
            <p>
              This track has a simple, reverb-heavy 606 beat which contrasts with the thicker 909s and 808s
              on the rest of the album. The track features gritty industrial vocals over an icy atmosphere
              underpinned by the 606.
              Skinny Puppy's drum beats tend to have a somewhat primitive, sloppy feel, as if they'd programmed
              in a few patterns by hitting buttons quasi-randomly, with multiple kits layered haphazardly.
              Given that the 606 has fewer sounds, the beat on "Incision" feels a bit less busy than other SP songs,
              not surprising for an early piece. Of course, they <em>have</em> to use the 606 cymbal
              and toms since they're there!
